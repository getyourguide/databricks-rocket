🚨 IMPORTANT: Please format your **PR title** in the following format:
    - `feat: JIRA_TICKET_ID DESCRIPTIVE_SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES` -> minor version bump (v1.2.3 -> v1.3.0)
    - `fix: JIRA_TICKET_ID DESCRIPTIVE_SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES` -> patch version bump (v1.2.3 -> v1.2.4)
    - `feat!: JIRA_TICKET_ID DESCRIPTIVE_SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES` -> major version bump (v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0)

    - Example: `feat: RR-2582 Remove All Bugs From Service`

This ensures that the release-please action can create a new version tag and changelog entries for you.
